# Scene Understanding for Autonomous Vehicles
This project aims to put in practice concepts and techniques to develop deep neural networks for being able to compute three main computer vision tasks: object detection, segmentation and recognition. These concepts will be applied in  an specific environent which is autonomous vehicles.
